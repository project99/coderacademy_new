    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Work and Education</h2>
    <section>
      I've been the wizard of Edge Pluto for the past 5 years.
      I had studied the magic of pixie dust but found it to be quite rudimentary. <br>
      So after working at the Castle of Pink Elephant for 3 years, I decided to pursure
      a Masters of Broom Riding - which landed me my current gig. I feel software development
      will help me to further my wizary agenda.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <section>
      When I'm not doing magic to protect all that is holy, I enjoy concocating
      magic potions for my own enjoyment and those of my fellow accomplices.
      I also enjoying riding my purple dragon and would sometimes race fellow dragon
      enthusiasts.
